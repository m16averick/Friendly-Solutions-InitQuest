# Friendly Solutions - code task

### Description

I decided to use my sample project, also available on this GitHub because it suits a lot our common needings. 

### Requirements

Despite basic react libraries provided by npm or yarn you'd also need [Devextreme React](https://js.devexpress.com/Overview/React/) which simplifies a lot data processing.

### Features

1. Display data loaded from given json in Devextreme's DataGrid.
2. Add your own task popup with automated id.
3. Searchpanel

### Bonus

1. Within the code you can find examples how do I use Context Provider, reducer and other react hooks.

2. The default layout is given from my sample project so please don't care for links around.

Happy reviewing :)
